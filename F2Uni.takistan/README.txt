F2 Mission Framework - Edited by Hunter & Batboyx2 for Phantactical
I take no credit for this template except for my edits. It was developed by the development team. (http://ferstaberinde.com/f2/en/index.php?title=Main_Page)|
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a template designed to make mission development more fluid and easy. It grants   |
the mission maker the tools to quickly place squads, easily edit unit gear, add detalied |
briefings etc into their mission. It is also easy for people who are not familiar with   |
scripting to use. One only has too copy the designed groups and add enemies/objectives   |
ect like he/she usually would. A tutorial on how to familiarize yourself with F2 can be  |
found on the PhanTactical forums:                                                        |
