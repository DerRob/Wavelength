Phramework
===============

![Ph](http://i5.minus.com/ib2ovbqhL4YeYU.png)

This is a repo for the Phramework, a tool designed to easy mission development in ArmA 2 and ArmA 3.

This is a template designed to make mission development more fluid and easy. It grants the mission maker the tools to quickly place squads, easily edit unit gear, add detailed briefings and so on into their mission. It is also easy for people who are not familiar with scripting to use. One only has to copy the designed groups and add enemies/objectives and so on like he/she usually would.

===============
Who is The Phramework For?

Ph is aimed at the new ArmA2 mission designer, although it is not intended for complete beginners. To use Ph the mission designer should have a basic understanding of:

    How to open the MP mission editor
    How to place and edit units, triggers, waypoints and markers in the editor
    The ArmA2 scripting syntax (for .sqf files)
    The roles of key files: description.ext and init.sqf
    The role of script files (.sqf files)


If a mission designer has already created his/her first few missions, everything in Ph should be relatively straightforward. In addition, mission designers with intermediate experience may also find Ph useful as a time-saver, or as the basis for their own personal base framework(s). 

===============
What's Next?

The best way to use Ph is to begin by reading through all manual pages for the Core Components. This will give you a solid understanding of the default options available, and help you plan your mission. If you have time, it is also useful to read through the manual pages for Optional Components too. Manual pages are also available for build-specific components. Once you have selected the build you wish to use, have a read of all these pages as well.
