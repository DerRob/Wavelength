Ph3 is a derivative of the [F3](http://ferstaberinde.com/f3/en//index.php?title=Main_Page) work. The content we have edited mainly consists of minor edits to gear, addition of many more factions from mods, and tweaks to the code, as well as a few minor additions. You can track F3's development at https://github.com/ferstaberinde/F3.

Phramework 3 Tutorial

PH3 Versions:

The latest version can usually be found here: (http://phantactical.com/forum/index.php?topic=3658.0).

Ph Versions:

The latest Stable and Development versions can usually be found here. However, the absolute latest version of the development version can be found on GitHub.

It is advised that you always use the stable version of Ph.

Installation:

Now that you have downloaded the ZIP achive, extract to the desktop and open the folder inside named "Ph". Within the folder is the mission template for Ph, which is identified as "Ph.VR"

Simply place this folder in....

Documents/Arma 3 - Other Profiles/*playername*/missions

Changing Maps & Renaming Missions:

By default, the template is set on the Virtual Reality map. This is shown by the folder's extension. To change the map, simply change the extension. To change the mission's name, change "Ph" to whatever you desire it to be.

*Keep in mind however, all missions you wish to submit to the community must be named in the following format:

PT_(CO/TVT)(Player Count)_(Mission Name)

Example:

PT_CO48_ISIS_Occupation

==================================================

In-Game Editor:

Once in-game, open up the editor and load up the Ph.VR template.

When it opens, you will see three factions. One for BLUFOR, INDFOR, and OPFOR. Pick the sides you're going to use, and delete the ones you won't.

*Be sure to keep the modules and units next to the "Required Modules" marker. Under no circumstances do you delete these.

To choose your faction, open up your mission's folder, go to the "Custom Factions" folder that comes with the download. Simply open the folder of the faction of your choice, and paste it back in the "assignGear" folder, overwriting the already present assignGear file.

==================================================

Editing the Briefing:

To edit your mission's briefing, open your mission folder, open the f folder, and open the briefing folder. Once inside, open the .sqf of the player's faction with notepad.

*It is highly recommended that you download and use Notepad++ for this. It makes editing way easier.

The following sections should be edited....

Credits: Who/what helped you during mission development.

Administration: Any important information you want the admins to know, like when the mission is supposed to end.
