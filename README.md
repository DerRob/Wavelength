PhanTactical-F2/F3 Frameworks
===============

This is the repository for the PhanTactical-modified F2 and F3 framework.

This is a template designed to make mission development more fluid and easy. It grants the mission maker the tools to quickly place squads, easily edit unit gear, add detailed briefings and so on into their mission. It is also easy for people who are not familiar with scripting to use. One only has to copy the designed groups and add enemies/objectives and so on like he/she usually would.

===============
The Objective of F2/F3

F2/F3 (like BAS f on which it is based) is an attempt to help the new mission designer take advantage of a library of pre-tested components that will increase the quality, re-playability and performance of his/her missions, whilst allowing him/her to focus on making his/her own unique ideas come to life.

===============
Framework vs. template

F2/F3 is a framework: an MP mission folder containing a library of scripts, functions and template files, plus a manual (this document). The framework is designed to provide the mission designer, after minimal additional configuration, with a selection of pre-tested features and functionality intended to improve the overall quality and re-playability of his/her mission.

Since F2/F3 is a framework, and not a template, the design of the actual mission is completely open; the framework is intended only to save time for the designer by providing components such as weather selections that work with join-in-progress (JIP), or pre-configured gear selections for re-equipping soldiers during the mission briefing. For many components care has also been taken to localize messages and texts (where used) into several languages.

Importantly, all components of the framework are fully explained in the online manual, feature extensive commenting within script files, and each can be disabled if desired. The manual is designed to guide the mission designer through the full configuration process, as well as provide instructions for optional components.

===============
Who is The Framework For?

F2/F3 is aimed at the new ArmA2 mission designer, although it is not intended for complete beginners. To use F2 the mission designer should have a basic understanding of:

    How to open the MP mission editor
    How to place and edit units, triggers, waypoints and markers in the editor
    The ArmA2 scripting syntax (for .sqf files)
    The roles of key files: description.ext and init.sqf
    The role of script files (.sqf files)


If a mission designer has already created his/her first few missions, everything in F2 should be relatively straightforward. In addition, mission designers with intermediate experience may also find F2 useful as a time-saver, or as the basis for their own personal base framework(s). 

===============
What's Next?

The best way to use F2/F3 is to begin by reading through all manual pages for the Core Components. This will give you a solid understanding of the default options available, and help you plan your mission. If you have time, it is also useful to read through the manual pages for Optional Components too. Manual pages are also available for build-specific components. Once you have selected the build you wish to use, have a read of all these pages as well.
