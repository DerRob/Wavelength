PhanTactical-F2
===============

This is the repository for the PhanTactical-modified F2 and F3 framework.

What we aim to do is give an aid for our mission developers in their creation of mission. The F2 framework sets a standard of quality and allows for the easier realization of a mission maker's goals. We split from the original F2 built in August of 2013, and F3 in February of 2014.
